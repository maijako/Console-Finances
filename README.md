# Console-Finances

## Description

This is a repository containing sample code that can be used to analyze a financial data set in a [browser console](https://maijako.github.io/Console-Finances). 

The code was written following a week's introductory course into JavaScript and uses simple for loops, concatenation, if statements and other beginner-friendly features.

The console output on the current dataset looks like this:

```
Financial Analysis
-------------------------
Total Months: 86
Net Profits Total: $38382578
Of which profits: $45710004
Of which losses: $-7327426
Average Change in Profits: $-2315.12
The greatest increase in profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
The greatest decrease in profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
```


## Usage

The code can be used on any financial data that's presented as a multidimensional array containing months and profits fluctuations inside a 'finances' variable.

It can also be used as an example for beginners in JavaScript, as a way to practice simple for loops, concatenation, and accessing elements in nested arrays.


## Credits

The original data set and the analysis brief were provided by [Trilogy Education](https://2u.com/) as part of the Front End Web Development bootcamp sponsored by the [Skills For Life](https://skillsforlife.edx.org/) program.
